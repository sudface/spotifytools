## What
Spdc is the authentication of you. This is a ~~low~~ no-budget project so can't afford OAuth verification or whatever.
Feel free to pull-request and fix that.

## How
You can get your spdc by logging into spotify online (open.spotify.com) and signing in.
It'll be stored in the cookies for that page

## Where
You can browse your cookies in the Application tab of the Developer Tools in Chromium browsers.
Copy the value of the sp_dc cookie.
